This looks like a fun little script\! Here's a `README.md` file for it:

# Random User Info Generator

This Python script allows you to fetch and display information about a random person based on a specified gender. It utilizes the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) to retrieve data such as name, location, email, and phone number.

## Features

  * Get random user details for "male" or "female" genders.
  * Displays name (title, first, last), city, state, country, email, and phone number.

## Requirements

  * Python 3.x
  * `requests` library

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or save the script):**
    If you have this script in a Git repository, you can clone it:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-directory>
    ```

    Otherwise, simply save the provided code as a Python file (e.g., `random_user.py`).

2.  **Install the required library:**

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

## Usage

Run the script from your terminal, providing the desired gender using the `--gender` argument.

```bash
python random_user.py --gender <gender>
```

Replace `<gender>` with either `male` or `female`.

### Examples

**To get information about a random male user:**

```bash
python random_user.py --gender male
```

**To get information about a random female user:**

```bash
python random_user.py --gender female
```

### Invalid Gender Input

If you enter an invalid gender (anything other than "male" or "female"), the script will inform you and exit.

```bash
python random_user.py --gender other
```
